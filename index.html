    <h3>Paper title:</h3>
    IDMVis: Temporal Event Sequence Visualization for Type 1 Diabetes Treatment Decision Support

    <h3>Authors:</h3>
    Yixuan Zhang, Kartik Chanana, Cody Dunne

    <h3>Abstract:</h3>
Type 1 diabetes is a chronic, incurable autoimmune disease affecting millions of Americans in which the body stops
producing insulin and blood glucose levels rise. The goal of intensive diabetes management is to lower average blood glucose through
frequent adjustments to insulin protocol, diet, and behavior. Manual logs and medical device data are collected by patients, but these
multiple sources are presented in disparate visualization designs to the clinicianâ€”making temporal inference difficult. We conducted a
design study over 18 months with clinicians performing intensive diabetes management. We present a data abstraction and novel
hierarchical task abstraction for this domain. We also contribute IDMVis: a visualization tool for temporal event sequences with
multidimensional, interrelated data. IDMVis includes a novel technique for folding and aligning records by dual sentinel events and
scaling the intermediate timeline. We validate our design decisions based on our domain abstractions, best practices, and through a
qualitative evaluation with six clinicians. The results of this study indicate that IDMVis accurately reflects the workflow of clinicians.
Using IDMVis, clinicians are able to identify issues of data quality such as missing or conflicting data, reconstruct patient records when
data is missing, differentiate between days with different patterns, and promote educational interventions after identifying discrepancies.
